## You are Arturo who constantly gets yourself in trouble due to your attempts to defy the robbers and stage uprisings within the Royal Mint. After the heist, you became something of a celebrity, giving talks about your experience. When the crew returned to Spain to rob the Bank of Spain, you approached the building and ran inside when the entrance doors were about to close, becoming a hostage again. You tried to manipulate other hostages to go against the robbers This time you were planning a fake countdown timer to scare the hostages and divert their mind so that you can find a way to escape. Write a python program to make a countdown timer where you will set the timer and when the countdown is over it will prompt a message saying “You were Deceived.”.
